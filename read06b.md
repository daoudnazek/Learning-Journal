# Computer Architecture and Logic 

## What make a computer, a computer ?

**Computer are everywhere**, It`s a machine used to manipulate information, and it perform four different tasks:

1. **Input** : takes information 
2. **Storage** : Store the information.
3. **Processing** : Process the information. 
4. **Output** : Output the result 

By the 20th century, computer started to use electrical componetents, instead of wood and metal.

In the past computer was used as a calculator, nowadays we use it for communication, play games, control robots , etc.

## Binary and Data

Computers are using electrical wires, which either be On, or Off, this means it can represent two values (true or false) , (On or Off), (Yes or No), (1 or 0). 

**Binary Number system** is differnt than the decimal system, it only deals with 1 and 0.

Each wire info (0,1) is called a bit , the more wires we have, the more information we get.

Every different types of in can be presented as number 
* **Text** : characters can be presented in numbers.
* **Sounds** : viberations can be presented in numbers.
* **Images** : Pixels can be presented in numbers.
So each element can be presented as sequence of number, which can be presented as (0 , 1).

## Circuits and Logic 

Circuits are made of millions of tiny electrical components, that used to combine the information, and there are many types of circuits 

* And 
* NAND
* NOT 
* NOR 
* OR 

Compilicated circuits take multiple signals, and combine them to give different results 

The smaller the cicuit is , the less time the signal will take to be deliverd , the faster the computer is.

## CPU , Memery , Input and output 

**Input** : mouse, keyboard, touching screen.
**Mermory** : the storage unit .
**CPU** : Central Processing Unit.
**Output** : displays , speakers, printer.

## Hardware and Software 

**Hardware** : 
* Chips 
* Wires 
* Circuits 
* Speakers 
* Plugs 

**Software** 
* Apps 
* Games 
* Websites 
* Maps
