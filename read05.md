## How to apply CSS for html files 

1. Using External CSS
By using external CSS files, we have to connect with html file using the code that typed in the head:
link rel="stylesheets" href="the path of the CSS file"

2. Using internal CSS
Here we can include CSS rules on the html file by entering the following code on the head :
style 
the CSS rules 
style 

3. Using CSS selectors 
Here we target the CSS rules to specific elements in the html file
and there are different types of selectors.

* **Universal selector**
* **Class selector**
* **ID selector** 
* **Type selector**
