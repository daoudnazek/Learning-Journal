## Comaparison Operators

**Comperison Operators** : Compare two values and return one single value of **True** or **False**.

* == (is equal to) : it compares two values and if they have the same value, eventhough the type is different, it returns **True**, else returns **False**.
* != ( is not equal to) : it compares two values and if they have the same value, eventhough the type is different, it returns **False**, else return **True**.
* === (strict equal to) : it compares two values and their data type, and if they the same value and data type, it returns **True** , else returns **False**.
* !== (strict not equal to) : it compares two values and their data type, and if they the same value and data type, it returns **False** , else returns **True**.
* ">" : greater than .  
* "<" : less than .
* ">=" : greater or equal to . 
* "<=" : less or equal to .

## Logical Operators 

**Logical Operators** : allow us to compare the results of more than one comparison operator 

* && (Logical and) : It only returns **True** of both values are **True**, else it returns **False**.
* || (Logical or) : It only returns **False** of both values are **False**, else it returns **True**.
* ! (Logical not) : it reverses the state of an expersion , if it`s **True**, it retuerns **False** , and vise versa.

## Loops 
 
**Loops** used for repetitive actions , they check the condition and if it is true, a block of code will be excuted, and then recheck the condition if still true it will repeat the excuted code, until the condition return False.
There are three common types of loops : 
1. **For** : used if we want to run the code specific number of times, and we use a counter for that.

2. **While** :  used if dont know the specific number of times we want to excute the code block , and no need for the timer.

3. **Do While** : it is the same as while but has a main difference, that the code block will at least be excuted for one time.
