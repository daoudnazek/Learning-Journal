## Functions 

**What is functions** : Functions is a group of statments used to perform a specific task, and whenever we want to perform that task, we just call it, instead of repeating the same set of statments. Also it`s a way of storing steps.

* Calling the function : Each function has its own name that is related to its task, anywhere you want to perfroom that task, you juct type the name of function and this is called **calling** the function.

* Parameters : some function need some information or values to perform its task, these called **parameters** and and they are typed between the paranthesis after the name of the function.

* Return VAlue : when any function expect to return a value after performing a task, this value called a **return value** 

* Function Declaration : To Declare a function we use the keyword "**Function**", then the name of the function called "**Identifier**" , then the code block between the two brackets.
